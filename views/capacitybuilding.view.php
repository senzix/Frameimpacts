            <p style="font-size:15px;"> Capacity Building is a conceptual approach to improve the
                knowledge and skills of an individual and teams for institutional or
                organizational development through training and workshops. The approaches
                focus on understanding the challenges to achieve development goals while enhancing
                their abilities to achieve measurable and sustainable results. It means much more
                than theoretical training as it includes practical learnings through contextualized
                activities.Capacity-building methods and techniques result in increased abilities of
                individuals, groups, and organisations to define and make strategic plans in align to
                their objectives and goals. It helps them to perform core functions, solve problems,
                and deal with development needs within a local context and in a sustainable manner.
